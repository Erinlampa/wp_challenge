I have errors in the code due to dictionary missing data? The scatter plots were from my testing with fewer cities. I will need some assistance figuring out what I am missing in the code. I'm thinking I need try/except after each append of list -- but I didn't want to mess with the code anymore. I did my best. Not THE best, my best.
