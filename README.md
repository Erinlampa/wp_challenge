# Observations
I have errors in the code due to dictionary missing data? The scatter plots were from my testing with fewer cities. I will need some assistance figuring out what I am missing in the code. I'm thinking I need try/except after each append of list -- but I didn't want to mess with the code anymore. I did my best. Not THE best, my best. 

I think going over defining functions and/or where to put functions within code (or how to go about determining) would be useful to go over.

From the 5 point scatter plot I can't really confirm anything. Plus, with global warming, it's going to be hot everywhere! :)

I'd like to be able to fix this assignment in the future once I can figure out what I've done incorrect.
